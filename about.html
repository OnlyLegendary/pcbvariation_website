      <h1>About PCB Variation</h1>
      <p>
        PCB Variation is my project about assembly bounty + temporal physical
        fingerprinting. I want to prove a board is real by how it’s built and how it
        drifts over time. It’s not a portfolio, it’s one focused experiment that I’m
        building in public.

        <h2>What assembly bounty means</h2>
        <p>
          If a board is actually built and tested, it should earn proof. The bounty part
          means the hardware itself helps verify the assembly so the work can be trusted.
        </p>

        <h2>Temporal physical fingerprinting</h2>
        <p>
          I measure tiny timing and analog shifts that happen as a board warms up, cools
          down, and ages. That time-based drift is the fingerprint I’m chasing.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I’m doing this</h2>
        <p>
          Counterfeits and fake builds are a real thing. I want a cheap, repeatable way
          to prove a board is legit using physics instead of just a sticker.

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Plan the fingerprints.</strong> Pick signals that drift in a measurable way.</li>
        <li><strong>Build the boards.</strong> Same design, different real-world quirks.</li>
        <li><strong>Capture the data.</strong> Log time-series traces, not just one snapshot.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyze the drift.</strong> Find the patterns that stay unique.</li>
        <li><strong>Prove the build.</strong> Tie it all together in a bounty-style proof.</li>
